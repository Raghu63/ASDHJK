            Johnson, a <span class="word">farmer</span> known for his <span class="word">eco-friendly</span> methods, 
            not only <span class="word">cultivated</span> organic vegetables like tomatoes and corn but also 
            adopted a <span class="word">greener</span> lifestyle. His <span class="word">sustainable</span> practices, 
            which included <span class="word">crop</span> rotation and limiting the use of <span class="word">household</span> 
            appliances to reduce his <span class="word">carbon</span> footprint, earned him 1st prize in "The Best Farmer" competition.
        </p>
        <p>
            Johnson actively worked to raise <span class="word">awareness</span> about eco-friendly farming, 
            encouraging others to <span class="word">recycle</span> and cut down on harmful chemicals. One day, 
            Johnson visited his friend Timmy, who ran his farm quite differently. Timmy decided to maximize 
            profits by using <span class="word">excessive</span> pesticides to meet deadlines. Johnson warned him, 
            "Timmy, this is dangerous. It's not only bad for natural resources but also harmful to people's health."
        </p>
        <p>
            Timmy laughed, replying: "We'll die before the environment is destroyed. For me, money is the best." 
            But soon, one of Timmy's customers was taken to the hospital due to <span class="word">food</span> poisoning. 
            Timmy's farm was examined by the local police. His illegal use of chemicals was discovered. As a result, 
            his farm must be closed. After that, Johnson visited Timmy: "I'm going to be penalized, I think I'll 
            goad all my life for my actions. I just... want some money."
        </p>
        <p>
            We can get the moral lesson from this story that we should adopt a <span class="word">sustainable</span> 
            lifestyle like Johnson. Protect the <span class="word">environment</span>, protect ourselves.

        <p>Tommy always <span class="word">considers</span> himself the <span class="word">breadwinner</span>, 
        thinking his <span class="word">responsibility</span> ends with bringing in the <span class="word">money</span>. 
        Meanwhile, his wife, Ellie, <span class="word">managed</span> the house as the <span class="word">homemaker</span>, 
        balancing her <span class="word">full-time</span> job and <span class="word">endless</span> <span class="word">household</span> 
        <span class="word">chores</span>.</p>

        <p>One evening, Ellie came home <span class="word">exhausted</span> to a <span class="word">messy</span> house. 
        She <span class="word">sighed</span>, began <span class="word">cleaning</span>, and still had to get 
        <span class="word">groceries</span>. Tommy sat on the couch, not offering any <span class="word">help</span>.</p>

        <p>“Tommy,” Ellie said, <span class="word">frustrated</span>, “I can’t keep doing all the <span class="word">heavy</span> 
        <span class="word">lifting</span> around here. You need to share the <span class="word">responsibility</span>.”</p>

        <p>Tommy looked <span class="word">surprised</span>. “I’m the <span class="word">breadwinner</span>,” he 
        replied. “I thought that was enough.”</p>

        <p>“I’m a <span class="word">breadwinner</span> and <span class="word">homemaker</span> too,” Ellie 
        explained. “It’s not just about earning <span class="word">money</span>. We’re a <span class="word">family</span>, 
        and we need to share everything—even the <span class="word">chores</span>.”</p>

        <p>Since then, Tommy began <span class="word">helping</span> with <span class="word">groceries</span> and 
        <span class="word">cleaning</span> up after dinner. Their son, Thomas, joined in, seeing his father’s 
        <span class="word">change</span>.</p>

        <p>Now, they share the <span class="word">household</span> <span class="word">chores</span> together. 
        This not only <span class="word">reduces</span> Ellie’s <span class="word">pressure</span> but also 
        <span class="word">strengthens</span> their <span class="word">relationship</span>. They start to 
        <span class="word">develop</span> <span class="word">family</span> <span class="word">values</span> 
        such as <span class="word">teamwork</span> and <span class="word">respect</span>. Moreover, they all 
        know that every <span class="word">family</span> member’s <span class="word">contribution</span> is 
        <span class="word">valuable</span>.</p>

            Mathew, a <span class="word">person</span> who has a <span class="word">passion</span> for 
            <span class="word">mental</span> <span class="word">health</span> <span class="word">issues</span>, 
            began his <span class="word">volunteering</span> journey during his <span class="word">summer</span> break. 
            He signed up to attend an online mental health <span class="word">support</span> forum, offering 
            <span class="word">resources</span> and hosting peer-support sessions for people in need. The 
            <span class="word">task</span> was moderate to conversations, which needed patience and compassion. 
            Mathew found <span class="word">fulfilment</span> in helping participants like a teenager named Evan, who slowly overcame her <span class="word">shyness</span> and shared her struggles.
        </p>
        <p>
            Inspired by his early success, Mathew <span class="word">founded</span> his <span class="word">initiative</span>: organizing 
            online treatment <span class="word">workshops</span> to help participants express their emotions. The 
            sessions gained <span class="word">popularity</span> and Mathew felt he was making a <span class="word">difference</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, his journey wasn’t without <span class="word">challenges</span>. Mathew <span class="word">struggled</span> with 
            his mental health, attacks of <span class="word">stress</span> that sometimes left him <span class="word">overwhelmed</span> and 
            <span class="word">exhausted</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            One <span class="word">incident</span> nearly <span class="word">derailed</span> him—during a live workshop, he experienced 
            a tension attack, suddenly ending the session. The <span class="word">chagrin</span> and <span class="word">guilt</span> made him consider giving up.
        </p>
        <p>
            But Mathew <span class="word">refused</span> to quit. He sought <span class="word">support</span> from his <span class="word">peers</span> on the forum, 
            who encouraged him to focus on <span class="word">progress</span> rather than <span class="word">ideals</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the end of the year, Mathew had helped <span class="word">hundreds</span> of people while discovering 
            his <span class="word">strength</span>. After all, he received a lot of <span class="word">letters</span> as thanks from people who 
            were helped by him. His journey was a <span class="word">testament</span> to the idea that even amidst struggles, one can still shine a light on others.
